# NeuralNetworks
Python Projects with Reports for the Neural Networks-Deep Learning course

The projects include the creation of:
1) a MLP for mnist digits classification, and comparisons with KNN and Nearest Centroid algorithms
2) SVM network for CIFAR10 image classification and same comparisons.
3) An image Autoencoder for image reconstruction, with comparisons to PCA.
